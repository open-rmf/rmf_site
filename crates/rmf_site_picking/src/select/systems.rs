/// service specified by the `selector` field of [`RunSelector`]. When that
/// service terminates, this workflow will resume running the inspector service
/// until the user requests some other mouse interaction service to run.

/// workflow. If you are not using the [`SelectionPlugin`] that we provide and
/// want to customize the inspector service, then you could use this to build a
