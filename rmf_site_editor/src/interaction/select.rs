/// The default selection behavior is the "inspector" service which allows the
/// user to select objects in the scene so that their properties get displayed
/// in the inspector panel. The inspector service will automatically be run by
/// this workflow at startup.
///
/// When the user asks for some other type of mouse interaction to begin, such as
/// drawing walls and floors, or placing models in the scene, this workflow will
/// "trim" (stop) the inspector workflow and inject the new requested interaction
/// mode into the workflow. The requested interaction mode is represented by a
/// service specified by the `selector` field of [`RunSelector`]. When that
/// service terminates, this workflow will resume running the inspector service
/// until the user requests some other mouse interaction service to run.
///
/// In most cases downstream users will not need to call this function since the
/// [`SelectionPlugin`] will use this to build and run the default selection
/// workflow. If you are not using the [`SelectionPlugin`] that we provide and
/// want to customize the inspector service, then you could use this to build a
